Lizzy intro:
L: Excuse me! Mister apple man! Are you there!?
P: Yes I'm here. Is that little lizzy outside my window?
L: You bet it is! My ma and pa sent me over to buy some apple stuff. 
P: What kind of apple stuff? There's a lot of different apple stuff you know. 
S: Sauce stuff. 
P: So....applesauce. 
S: Yeah, that stuff! I forgot what it was called, but you remember so it's fine. 
P: Alright Lizzy, I'll get some applesauce ready for you. How many did your parents want?
S: two. 
P: Alright, two jars of applesauce coming right up. 

1:
L: Hey, mister? Is there anything different aout your applesauce? Cus I really like the ones in the plastic cups from stores. 
P: Well, mine tastes like candy because of how sweet the applesI use are. It also doesn't use as much sugar. 
L: What? Why would less sugar make it taste better? More sugar makes everything better. 
P: Not necessarily. It's more that the apples taste really good, so they don't need as much sugar.
L: That's not a thing. You can always add more sugar. 
P: Well, you can, but that doesn't make it better. 
L: Yeah it does!
P: .......You know what it does. But I can only put so much in this recipe. If I put more in, it will explode. 
L: Really! That sounds cool! Do it!
P: My house would burn down, and then you can't get more applesauce.
L: Oh yeah. Okay, I give you official permission to use les sugar. 
P: Thank you, You're very kind. 

2:
L: Hey, where do you get your apples? Do you buy them from the store like my parents?
P: No, I have some trees in my backyard. 
L: Why would that help you get apples?
P: They're apple trees. I pick all of my apples from them. 
L: Wait, you have trees that grow apples? Can I go pick some?
P: Mabye later, when I'm done making the applesauce. 
L: Alright, it's a deal. You better not back out now!
P: Wouldn't dream of it. 

3:
L: Are you almost done? You've been taking a long time. 
P: Making food isn't a simple quick process. 
L: Why not? Why does it take so long? 
P: Because the apples need to soften up in the water, which takes some time. 
L: Okay, but why does it take so much time. 
P: It just does. 
L: That's not a good answer. 
P: Well, I'm a farmer. I don't have all the answers. I'm no scientist. 
L: Would they be able to explain it?
P: Maybe. There isn't a guarantee though. 
L: That's silly. Why don't people have answers to simple questions. 
P: You'll understand why when you're older.
